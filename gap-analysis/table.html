<h1>Gap Analysis - Tables of User Needs </h1>
<p>This section is work in progress for  tables format for the coga roadmap. It identifies user needs that are not currently fully addressed by accessibility.</p>
<p>Each  table addresses a group of user needs represented by   a few related user stories of the form of "As a <em>&lt;role&gt;,</em> I want <em>&lt;goal/desire&gt;</em> so that <em>&lt;benefit&gt;</em>".</p>
<p>The tables show how  related user needs can be met though:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authoring techniques for content using HTML,</li>
  <li>How this can be addressed in WCAG </li>
  <li>New semantics that may be required to address this user need, such as extra aria attributes</li>
  <li>Any personalization requirements</li>
  <li>Operating System support or other support that may be required to meet this user need</li>
</ul>
<p>Note we also have the summary at https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis_Summary#Summary_of_Issues</p>
<p><strong>Please note that this table is incomplete and is a work in progress. (We are publishing it early to solicit early feedback.</strong>) For a later version see ....</p>

<h2>
Table 1: Authentication </h2>
<p>About the user: Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text, or remembering passwords, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
<p>Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not use the content or service, such as difficult security mechanisms that require coping or remembering passwords often bar people with cognitive disabilities from accessing content or using a service at all. </p>
<p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forget passwords I need to be able to use a site without remembering or coping passwords and user names so that I can use this service.</li>
  <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills I want to be able to get help without going though voiceML menu system so that I can set an appointment or find out some information</li>
  <li>As a user who has weak executive function I need the process to get help to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it</li>
</ul>

   <h2>Table 2: Context and distractions</h2>
   <p>About the user: Distractions can cause people with cognitive disabilities to lose focus on the current action being performed or draw attention away from the primary content and can be difficult for some users to know how to understand, avoid and/or stop them. </p>
   <p>Once people have become distracted it can be difficult for them to remember what they were doing. This is especially problematic for people with both low attention and impaired memory such as people with dementia.</p>
   <p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
   <br><br>
   <ul>
     <li>As a user who has memory impairments and difficulty concentrating on an activity, I need to use websites without encountering unnecessary interuptions.</li>
     <li>As a user who has trouble remembering where I am or how I got there, I want content with contextual clues that aid my recollection of what I was doing, especially when I am momentarily distracted.</li>
     <li>As a user who loses focus on primary content due to distractions caused by secondary content, I need a feature that allows me to remove, hide, or prevent rendering of non-primary information on a page or site.</li>

    <h2>Table 3: Entering data, error prevention &amp; recovery </h2>
    <p>About the user: Filling out forms and similar tasks can be overwhelming for most people with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities such as dyslexia or attention related disabilities. Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying   text,  difficult or impossible. Other   contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
    <p>Many people learning disability can not remember numbers such as their post code, Social Security or Credit Card numbers. Many people even need their to check phone number. This makes entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desk or take a brake.</p>
    <p>Many users find it very difficult to copy information, due to low visual memory or impaired executive function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This lead to following user stories:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As a user who needs to look up my post code I do not want the session to time out while I try and find the information needed.</li>
      <li>As a user who needs to take brakes during tasks like filling in a form I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer crashes so that i do not have to start over again, (which can create a cycle and each time I reenter my data i am more tiered and more likely to make mistakes)</li>
      <li>As a user with difficalty typing numbers in the right order I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely.</li>
      <li>As a user who finds entering information stressful I want to enter as little information as I can so that it is manageable</li>

<h3>Table 6: Simple and clear interface

<p>About the user:  Many people can not learn easily new design metaphors or remember things that they learned (such as people with MCI or   dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or impossible to locate a desired items to interact with and  know what interaction may do. The user can feel lost or overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Many users can be overwhelmed by too many options, or too much information. If reading is slow then two much information mixed together will make it difficult or impossible to find the information you need.</p>

<h3>Table 7: Familiar  interface</h3>
<p>About the user: Many people can not learn easily new design metaphors or remember things that they learned (such as people with MCI or   dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or impossible to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>locate a desired items to interact with and </li>
  <li> know what interaction may do</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able to use   the web for people who can not remember new symbols (such as some people   with memory related impairments like dementia).Therefore the user needs things to be familiar including</p>
<ul>
  <li>location of elements</li>
  <li>symbols </li>
  <li>text used</li>
  <li>how to get help</li>
</ul>
<p> However what is   familiar for one user may be new for another. So the interface needs to be familiar to the individual user</p>

<h2>Table 8: Navigating the system</h2>
<p>About the user: Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying   text, or remembering passwords, difficult or impossible. Other   contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
<p>Sometimes developers put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not  use the content or service.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Voice XML enable voice dialogs systems and voice browsers. Sometimes the user needs to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind   such as the number that is being presented as an option , whilst   processing the terms that follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills I want to be able to get help without going though voiceML menu system so that I can set an appointment or find out some information</li>
  <li>As a user who has weak executive function I need the process to get help to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it</li>
